# Algorithm-Visualizer
It visualize the pre-programmed algorithm I have written to find the shortest path between two points. <br>
(Currently only 2, because I realize in this project the ones I have is good enough, but I will add more)<br> <br>
The user can select their action in menu: draw start, draw end, draw wall. <br>
(Color changing option is available so you can have different color of walls and paths) <br> <br>
For more usablity and mostly for fun, I have added picture upload option, such that user can upload their image, whether it's a map or a picture of cat, 
the image then become the background, and user can sketch their wall on top of the image...<br>
And there is a slider, user can drag the slider, and the algorithms I wrote will auto highlight and draw walls based on the background image uploaded. <br>
For example, if you upload a picture of map and drag the slider to a proper point, it will highlight (draw walls on) the structures and leave the roads as possible path, 
and you can draw a start and draw an end to find the shortest path in that map.
## How to start
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
The app is ready to be deployed!

## Demo

#### find path
<img src='src/images/findPath1'/>
